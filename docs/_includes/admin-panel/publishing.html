        <li>Author Image (Thumbnail)</li>
        <li>Post Archive Link</li>
        <li>Twitter Link</li>

    <p><strong>Author Image (Gravatar)</strong></p>
    <p><em>Create a Gravatar account using the same email address that is in your user profile.</em></p>
    <p><a title="Gravatar" href="http://gravatar.com/" target="_blank">Gravatar</a>&nbsp;is a free service that allows you to configure a personal avatar image that “follows you around” as you post comments on blogs and sites throughout the Internet. As long as you use the email address associated with your Gravatar account, you’ll have an image of you (or your brand) when you leave comments.</p>
    <p>To configure an Author Image in the Author Box you will need to create a Gravatar account using the same email address that is configured in your user profile on your site.</p>
    <p><strong>Post Archive Link</strong></p>
    <p>This is automatically generated per author, no configuration required.</p>
    <p><strong>Twitter, Facebook, and Google+ Links</strong></p>
    <p>These are configured for each author in their user profiles. To change yours, in the left navigation of the WordPress admin panel go to&nbsp;<em>Users&nbsp;</em>-&gt;<em>&nbsp;Your Profile.</em></p>
