    <p><em>Change the contrast to Dark or Light then click Save Changes.</em></p>
    <p>The main function is to switch the contrast of text so that it’s readable in relation to customized backgrounds. You can change your site’s background to either a solid color or an uploaded image in&nbsp;<em>Appearances</em>&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;<em>Backgrounds</em>, but depending on the color or image selected, you could end up with dark text against a dark background making it impossible to read.</p>
    <p>In these cases, switch the contrast.</p>
