    <p>All WordPress sites are composed of two primary areas: the site and the admin panel. The site is often called the front end, and the admin panel is often called the backend.</p>
    <p>Your public facing blog, available for all the world to see, will be referred to as “the site” throughout this documentation.</p>
    <p>The private, password protected, WordPress administration area will be referred to as “the admin panel” throughout this documentation.</p>
    <p>You can usually access the admin panel of your site by adding&nbsp;<em>/wp-admin</em>&nbsp;to the end of your site’s address.</p>
    <blockquote><p>Public Site URL: http://example.com</p>
        <p>Private Admin URL: http://example.com/wp-admin</p></blockquote>
    <p>If you need assistance with accessing your site’s admin panel, contact your web host.</p>
