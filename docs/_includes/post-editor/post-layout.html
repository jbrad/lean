<div class="bs-docs-section">
    <h1 id="post-layout" class="page-header">Post Layout</h1>

    <p>If you have a post with content that requires extra width, like a wide image or video, you can choose to hide the sidebar. To accomplish this same effect on a page, use the Full-width page template.</p>
