    <p class="lead">This section will show page or post content.</p>
    <p>If you are on the index page, which is usually the front page of your site, it will show a list of blog posts. If you are on a single page, like the About page for example, it will only show the content you added when you edited the About page in the&nbsp;<em>Pages</em>&nbsp;section of the admin panel. If you are on a single post, this page will show the post content and the comments for the post by default.</p>
