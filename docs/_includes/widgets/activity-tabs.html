    <p>The&nbsp;<em>Activity Tabs&nbsp;</em>widget was designed to keep visitors on your site by creating a list of popular, active, or topical posts. Visitors often enter a site via a link to a single post, and not through the home page. In cases like this, it is considered good practice to provide a strategic list of additional posts to entice readers to stick around and read more articles.</p>
