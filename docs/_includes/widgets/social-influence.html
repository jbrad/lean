    <h3 id="social-influence-description">Description</h3>
    <p>The social influence widget was designed to help you establish credibility with your growing readership. It integrates with both Twitter and Facebook Fan Pages.</p>
    <p>If you are in the process of building your online readership, this is an important visual indicator for both you and your audience. You can create and measure goals based on this number. Your audience will be able to identify if you are a new, up-and-coming publisher and help you get the word out. Or, if you have a large number of followers, then new readers will be able to&nbsp;ascertain&nbsp;a degree of credibility with your work.</p>
    <p>The widget makes a call to Twitter &amp; Facebook once a day to fetch current numbers, then it uses a saved version of these values for 24 hours. This is due to restrictions imposed by Twitter and Facebook.</p>
