    <p>DIMENSIONS: 300 pixels wide by 250 pixels tall.</p>
    <p>Add a single image to you sidebar, and select the destination page, where users are taken, when it is clicked. This works great for advertisements, but it is also useful to drive traffic to other parts of your own website.</p>
    <p>Instead of putting blog post categories in your top navigation, why not create unique images for each one, and put them in your sidebar? Get creative!</p>
    <blockquote><p>NOTE If your image is not sized correctly before you upload, visual distortion will occur.</p></blockquote>
