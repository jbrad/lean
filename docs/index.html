    <h2 class="bs-docs-featurette-title">Publishers. <small>Lean’s design lets your content be the star of the show.</small></h2>
    <p class="lead">The theme is intentionally clean and simple so that it does not distract visitors from the most important thing of all, your content. It’s strategically organized and positioned each section so that visitors can immediately know who you are and what you want to communicate. There’s also an ad space if you want to monetize your content, all the typical social icons for visitors to find you on popular social sites. Perhaps the most important thing of all is that Lean Theme is loaded with SEO features that attract the attention of search engines like Google.</p>
