# Lean Theme
## Standard, Bootstrap 3, Font Awesome
### Wordpress Theme

#### Responsive Design. 
##### Built with Bootstrap, so you know it's mobile-first.
Lean is built with Bootstrap 3 and its responsive grid. Your site will properly resize to the device that it is being viewed on.

#### SEO Built-in. 
##### The markup is solid, plus an admin widget.
The entire theme was built with HTML5 in mind. The markup was designed with SEO in mind so you don't need to. There's also a SEO admin widget to input your meta description and gives you a preview of what it will look like on Google. If you use another SEO plugin, it will let that plugin do it's thing instead.

#### Post Formats. 
##### A distinct design for each post format.
Lean supports the Standard, Status, Image, Link, Quote, Video, Aside and Gallery post formats. Who doesn't like variety, right?

#### SASS. 
##### Variables for easy modifications, and compiled with SASS.
All of the CSS files are built with SASS and then compiled and minified. All of the colors can easily be modified in the _variables.scss file. Only the necessary styles from [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) and [Font Awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) are included, but excluded styles can easily be added.

#### Build Tasks. 
##### Grunt and Bower all the things.
The entire theme is built with Grunt. There are tasks for compiling your SASS and JavaScript. All third-party libraries are pulled in using Bower and only used during compile time. You can also view the documentation using Jekyll.

#### Page Templates. 
##### Create an attractive home or landing page.
There are a number of custom page templates that come with Lean. There is an Image Slider (the current page you're viewing), Jumbotron, Sitemap, Archives, Full Width (without sidebar) and Default (with sidebar).
